Welcome to the Book of Revelation!
<p>The purpose of this comprehensive study of the Book of Revelation is to systematically find the connections that shed light on the text of Scripture from Scripture. Too many have tried to insert their ideas into the Book of Revelation without having connections from the rest of the Bible. This Revelation study companion will help to shine a light on a wide array of biblical topics. Here are just a few that might spark your interest…</p>
<p>The Trinity, parables, prophecy, the Book of Life, the security of salvation for the believer, the lake of fire, why God killed Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu, why God rejected Cain’s sacrifice, the 70th week of Daniel, pre-trib and pre-wrath rapture, Armageddon, the redemption of Israel, the Antichrist and False Prophet, the second coming of Christ, the 1000-year Kingdom, the New Heaven and New Earth, typology within Scripture, the chiastic structure of the Bible, the redemption written in the stars, and so much more! We will address core doctrines and eschatological (End Times) texts found throughout the Bible.</p>
So buckle up and get ready for one of the deepest and most fruitful studies that will take us from Genesis to Revelation.
