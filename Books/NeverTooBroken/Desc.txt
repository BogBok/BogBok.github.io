Never Too Broken for God (2024 revised version) is a book written for both Christian men and women who struggle with feeling too broken for God to use. My prayer is for God to use this book to reach many of our brothers and sisters who have been called by God out of sin and debauchery to be workers for Christ. I want them to know that they are not alone and God has a purpose for them in His plan.
<p>I knew that Christians who were once so hopeless and broken because of their own choices need a book that encourages, motivates, strengthens, sharpens, and calls them to work for the Glory of God. They need to understand that everyone has fallen short of the Glory of God and that we ALL need the atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
God chose to save us from such a dark place as a testimony to His Grace, and so He can highlight His strength through our weakness. By guiding them biblically from brokenness to maturity, they will become equipped with the knowledge and understanding of how to walk with Christ and move forward into becoming an ambassador for Christ by spreading the Gospel with confidence.
