In this verse-by-verse Bible study, we will allow the entirety of Scripture to answer the many difficult passages in the letter to the Hebrews. We will see that this letter intends to show a Jewish audience that Jesus is much greater than the angels, the prophets, the high priest, and the patriarchs. We will discuss topics such as the security of believers' salvation, explore in depth who Melchizedek is, and examine how typological images from the Old Testament provide clear answers to difficult questions.
