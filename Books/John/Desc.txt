The Holy Spirit inspired John to write his gospel in a way that is simple enough for a baby Christian to read and comprehend, as well as in a deep typological and prophetic way for a mature Christian to spend their life studying and gleaning from the mysteries that he left for us.
<p>This verse-by-verse study began as my personal notes from years of studying, but is now being released because I felt called to share them with others. We will dive deep into this book and will use Scripture as our guide to interpret the treasures that John has left for us. We will dive deeply into the typological and prophetic pictures within this book and connect them in detail to their parallel passages in the Bible. The goal for this study is to strengthen your biblical literacy and relationship with Jesus by gaining a profound understanding that the plan of redemption was never an afterthought but instead was always the plan.</p>
We will see the deep-rooted connections between the Old and New Testaments, and we will see how the entirety of Scripture testifies to Christ. We will look at the prophetic meanings of parables, the 7 miracles of Jesus, Jesusâ€™ deity, the trinity, and so much more. So buckle up and get ready for an amazing and profound study in the Gospel of John.
