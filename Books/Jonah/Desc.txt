The story of Jonah is one of the most well-known in the Bible. It ranks alongside the stories of Adam and Eve's fall, Noah's flood, and Sodom and Gomorrah. Even atheists and skeptics are aware of Jonah and the great fish.
<p>The issue we run into is that familiarity causes us to become lazy and gloss over the details within the story that were intentionally placed there by God to show us something.</p>
<p>Our presupposition and prior knowledge cause us to miss the typological and prophetic implications of the book.</p>
<p>Just as the rest of the Bible, the story of Jonah is a living parable that God ordained to point to Christ. These were historical people and events with a surface-level and direct meaning and purpose. But they also double as prophetic, typological pictures of greater truth.</p>
<p>When studying Biblical typology, we must note that we are not gaining "new revelation."</p>
<p>Instead, the New Testament reveals the previously hidden meanings of Old Testament accounts and shows us the intentionality and symbolism that God has interwoven into history and creation itself.</p>
<p>Like Jesus said in John 5:39 (LSB): “You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that bear witness about Me;”</p>
So let’s get ready to dive into the deep prophetic and typological pictures that have been waiting for us in the book of Jonah all along. We, as Jonah, are going to go deep below the surface and allow God to take us where he wants in this text.
