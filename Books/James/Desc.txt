This letter was written by James, the brother of Jesus (Matthew 13:55) and brother of Jude (Jude 1:1), who was the elder who led the Jerusalem church (Acts 15).
<p>The name James is a transliteration of the Greek word Ἰάκωβος (iakōbos), which is the Hebrew name, יַעֲקֹב(yaʿăqōḇ), and in English we would say, Jacob.</p>
<p>Scholars believe that it was written between A.D. 40–45 and that it was written to predominantly Jewish Christian house churches outside of Jerusalem, based on its mention of the “twelve tribes in the Dispersion” (James 1:1).</p>
<p>The Book of James is directed to Jewish Christians scattered among all the nations. James was writing to Jews to encourage them to continue growing in this new Christian faith.</p>
<p>James emphasizes that good actions will naturally flow from those who are filled with the Spirit and asks if someone has saving faith if the Spirit's fruits are absent. We see Paul describe something similar in Galatians 5:22-23.</p>
<p>According to history, James was the head of the Church in Jerusalem, and he was martyred between 62 and 69 A.D. by being stoned to death by the Pharisees on the order of High Priest Ananus.</p>
<p>Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews (20.9.1): “Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity [to exercise his authority]. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the Sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a Sanhedrin without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.”</p>
<p>We are going to examine the text by using scripture to interpret scripture. We will follow the connections that James is drawing from to give us a rich and thorough understanding of the message the Holy Spirit was intending to convey to the readers of this letter.</p>
We will be able to extract so much applicational truth that will help us grow in our walk with Christ. We will learn about the importance of selfless love and how the fruit in our lives is the proof of our genuine faith in Christ. And we will be able to see the focus that James makes on the condition of the hearts of those who proclaim faith in Christ.
